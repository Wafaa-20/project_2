<h1>Camelids</h1>
<p>

The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly 
herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. They have a three chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile; and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw.They have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,look longer still. (from Wikipedia)
